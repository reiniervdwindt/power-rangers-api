Its torso was actually a large snake mouth, which could open up and fire what he called \"tonsil snakes\" at his foes, which would then wrap up and weaken their targets, draining them of their life energy. His arms were a pair of cobras and his legs were a bunch of snakes coiled around each other. The Zapper Apple on his crown also possessed great power, possibly strong enough to have been able to destroy the Power Rangers with a single shot from a weapon charged by it. Confronting four of the Rangers in Angel Grove Park, Snizzard overwhelmed and nearly destroyed them with an arrow charged with energy from his crown's Zapper Apple. It was then that Kimberly Hart arrived and saved her teammates. After defeating a group of Putties that Snizzard had summoned, Kimberly slew the reptilian monster by firing an arrow of her own into his Zapper Apple.",

The Parrot appeared as a reddish-pink color with one head on the top and the other on the chest. The monster's main weakness was expolited by the Rangers when a Pamango fruit was given to it, causing the two heads to bicker. Rita then made it grow after the Rangers gave it a good trashing. The Megazord and Dragonzord then battled the Two-Headed Parrot with neither side gaining an upper hand. The zord attacks seemed to only agitate the parrot, rather than weaken it, so they formed the Ultrazord. After the Ultrazord was formed the Two-Headed Parrot cowered before the Ultrazord, begging them not to use it on it. Jason then apologetically\u00a0explained that they had no choice, and then it was destroyed by the Ultrazord. Although it was never mentioned in the episode, the monster's action figure packaging indicates that the two heads are named Pete and Repeat.",

The Megazord battle with Weaveworm seemed to be going nowhere until Weaveworm upped the ante with his cocoon attack. He was surprisingly good at hand to hand combat, the Megazord's punches not fazing him. However, when the Dragonzord comes to the rescue and frees the Megazord from its sealed containment, the tide is turned. The Rangers form the MegaDragonzord, and use the spinning Z-Sphere to obliterate Weaveworm in a flash of bright light. Before the zord battle, the Dragonzord Battle Mode is disassembled, perhaps in a delayed formation of the MegaDragonzord, much like when the Ultrazord was formed against Samurai Fan Man.",
